It is desirable that a scholarship provides some reasonable financial support compared to the total expenditure of the student. Hence it has been decided that the minimum amount of scholarship that can be established at PEC will be Rs. 50000 per annum. Donors may wish to establish scholarships with larger amounts.In order to provide a scholarship of Rs. 50000 per annum it is proposed to establish an endowment of Rs. 10 lakhs. The interest earned on this endowment will be used to disburse the scholarship amount. The excess interest (more than 5 percent) will be ploughed back to the endowment so that its amount also increases and in future the scholarship amount can be increased. It may be noted that despite some interest amount being added to the endowment the real value of endowment will reduce over a period of time due to inflation and a top up may be needed after some time.A donor can specify the criteria for selection of students. These criteria could include merit (minimum CGPA for example) means (maximum income limit for example) or both. A donor could also specify the department in which the scholarship is to be established the year of the student (1st 2nd 3rd or 4th) or gender.The scholarship can be named as per the wishes of the donor.Currently the Institute is interested in supporting the following category of students:Students from low income families:Please note that the Institute may decide on additional criteria on eligibility for scholarships. For example it is expected that students getting means based scholarship will pass all courses while students getting merit based scholarships will have a CGPA of at least 8.5. It is also required that the student has not been barred as part of disciplinary action.To encourage establishment of endowment based scholarships for those categories of students whom the Institute wants to support it has been decided that the scholarship amount will be matched by the Institute. So if a donor gives an endowment of Rs. 10 lakhs for a scholarship for a student from low income family with income less than Rs. 5 lakhs per annum the amount of scholarship to the student will be Rs. 1 lakh per annum (Rs. 50000 from the interest of the endowment and Rs. 50000 from the Institute funds).Benefit to the Donor:Download PDFMake Donation

Notably the seminar was conducted to commemorate the 16th death anniversary of Dr. Kalpana Chawla the star alumni of Aerospace Engineering Department of PEC who disappeared in the sky during Columbia Disaster on 1st February 2003. The event was organized in association with Aeronautical Society of India (Chandigarh Branch) under the sponsorship of TEQIP-III.Sh. Rajiv Rattan Director Science & Technology Haryana was the Chief Guest in the Seminar where as Dr. S.C. Sharma was the Guest of honour. They inspired the young minds to achieve the target while dreaming high like Kalpana. The seminar was attended by more than one hundred & fifty delegates from all over the country including students faculty scientists and personnel working in the field of space flight.It was Dr. V. Adimurthy who delivered ‘Dr. Kalpana Chawla Memorial Lecture – 2019’ during inaugural session on day one of the event. The title of the lecture was ‘Space Exploration: Past Present and the Future’ where Dr. Adimurthy talked about the quest of humanity to explore the unexplored. Starting from the earlier days of ISRO he described how learning by failing held ISRO to generate human resource for the country in the field of space flight. He then put light on some current news like about achievements of ISRO he pointed out the simultaneous launch of 104 satellites by PSLV-C37 on 15.02.2017. He put light on future exploration mission by ISRO where after Mars eyes are set on Venus Titan moon of Saturn.The first expert lecture was delivered by Dr. Pankaj Priyadarshi from VSSC on multidisciplinary design optimization of aerospace vehicles where he introduced the subject of optimization to students from very basic example of day to day life but finally linked it how it is useful in solving aerospace related problems. In the second expert talk Shri Shyam Mohan N talked about winged re-entry vehicles and ISRO experiments with reusable launch vehicles. These experiments were successfully conducted by ISRO and will be instrumental in India’s dream of manned mission to space. The final lecture of day one was delivered by Sh Ankur Nagpal scientist from VSSC-ISRO who discussed about challenges faced during establishment of 1-m Hypersonic tunnel at VSSC. The challenges were immense but were successfully resolved by hard work and team work of Indian scientists/engineers from over 600 industries and institution from all over the country.The second day of the event started with the talk of Dr. Sudhir Kamle Professor in the department of Aerospace of IIT Kanpur where he talked about material which are used during space flight and how material behavior changes in low pressure and low temperature environment of space and must be taken care of. He also talked about the success story of JUGNU – the student satellite program of IIT Kanpur.The second lecture of the day was delivered by Dr. V. Ashok Deputy Director of VSSC-ISRO where he talked about aerodynamic and aerothermal problems in launch vehicles. He also gave insights on how problem solving is done in case of space vehicles where regulator norms are even stringent than atmospheric vehicles.In the third lecture Sh. Lazar T. Chitilappilly spoke about propulsion research on rockets and scramjet in ISRO. Shri S Rajendran then enlightened the audience about launch vehicle structures and aero-elasticity problems in space vehicles. It was followed by final talk by Dr. Amarjit Singh of Aerospace Engineering Department of PEC where need of high speed research and facility to such research was discussed by citing examples of such facilities from all over the globe.Dr. Rakesh Kumar Professor & Head of Aerospace Engineering Department said that this was a rare opportunity where such a number of eminent Scientists from ISRO Trivandrum have shared every aspects of space flight and discussed various challenges they faced and are likely to face.

https://pec.ac.in/donations/content/establishing-scholarships-financially-underprivileged-students#main-content,<p>,Punjab Engineering College Chandigarh is looking to establish several scholarships for its students through philanthropic contributions. Currently an undergraduate student spends roughly Rs. 2.5 lakhs a year on tuition lodging and boarding. It is desirable that a scholarship provides some reasonable financial support compared to the total expenditure of the student. Hence it has been decided that the minimum amount of scholarship that can be established at PEC will be Rs. 50000 per annum. Donors may wish to establish scholarships with larger amounts.In order to provide a scholarship of Rs. 50000 per annum it is proposed to establish an endowment of Rs. 10 lakhs. The interest earned on this endowment will be used to disburse the scholarship amount. The excess interest (more than 5 percent) will be ploughed back to the endowment so that its amount also increases and in future the scholarship amount can be increased. It may be noted that despite some interest amount being added to the endowment the real value of endowment will reduce over a period of time due to inflation and a top up may be needed after some time.A donor can specify the criteria for selection of students. These criteria could include merit (minimum CGPA for example) means (maximum income limit for example) or both. A donor could also specify the department in which the scholarship is to be established the year of the student (1st 2nd 3rd or 4th) or gender.The scholarship can be named as per the wishes of the donor.Currently the Institute is interested in supporting the following category of students:Students from low income families:Please note that the Institute may decide on additional criteria on eligibility for scholarships. For example it is expected that students getting means based scholarship will pass all courses while students getting merit based scholarships will have a CGPA of at least 8.5. It is also required that the student has not been barred as part of disciplinary action.To encourage establishment of endowment based scholarships for those categories of students whom the Institute wants to support it has been decided that the scholarship amount will be matched by the Institute. So if a donor gives an endowment of Rs. 10 lakhs for a scholarship for a student from low income family with income less than Rs. 5 lakhs per annum the amount of scholarship to the student will be Rs. 1 lakh per annum (Rs. 50000 from the interest of the endowment and Rs. 50000 from the Institute funds).Benefit to the Donor:Download PDFMake Donation

N Sharma, Associate Professor, Department of Applied Sciences, PEC University of Technology has been awarded a project as Co-PI with research grant of Rs 21 Lakh to study snow and glaciers. It is a cluster of multi-institutional national networked project. Dr Sharma happens to be among top researchers who have been selected from prestigious organisations of national repute like IIT- Bombay, Kanpur, Chennai, Kharagpur, IIST-ISRO, DTRL, DRDO, IARI and Central Universities etc it said. It will involve 4 Region-wise central laboratory facilities which will also maintain data acquired. The IIT- Bombay has been identified as national nodal agency to coordinate and maintain data portal of the project through setting up a coordination cell. Total duration of the project is 3 years. The project involves characterization of physical and optical properties of different forms of snow and glaciers using ground truth data collection and remote sensing techniques, he pointed out. The physical process analysis of snow features will provide crucial information to understand and model the snow physical parameters. This will help in creating a data base of such processes from field input and up scaling them on satellite data and thus will help in better understanding of snow and glacier formation. The major beneficiaries of the output of the project will be Army, BRO, DRDO, Deptt of Space Labs, MoEF, MoES, Hydroelectric Energy Producers, Agriculture operators etc. Having second project on glaciers to his credit, Dr Sharma is involved in paleoclimatic studies of glaciers (Hamtah and Siachin) for more than a decade is opined that west Himalayan glaciers are definitely retreating due to global warming. Right from its origin i.e 4600 million years earth had five ice ages. The variations in the Earth’s orbit and shifting plate tectonics spur the waxing and waning of these periods. At present we are living in the interglacial warmer period, hence geologically speaking there is nothing abnormal about global warming. However, anthropogenic forcing from increased greenhouse gases and intensive use of fossil fuels have alarmed the situation to such an extent that human beings own existence is at stake.PEC welcomed Mr. Bikram Singh Garewal, the university’s oldest alum at Homecoming 2020: Global Alumni Meet.
